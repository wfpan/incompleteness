# incompleteness
This is the replication package for our work submitted to IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering: Weifeng Pan, Hua Ming, Khouloud Gaaloul, Wei Wu, Bailin Yang. XXXXXXXX. IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering, 2024, XX(XX): XXXX-XXXX. [[PDF](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/)]

# Code
This directory will contain the source code of our implementation. It is now empty. The source code will be available once our work is officially accepted.

# datasets
This directory contains the data set used to train different prediction models.

# metricDescription
This directory contains two files describing the metrics used in our work. Specifically, "Code&SNA Metrics" describes both the code metrics and the network metrics. "Evaluation Metrics" describes the performance evaluation metrics.  

# missingSystems
This directory contains the source code of two missing systems.

# results
This directory contains the results that we obtained in the experiments.
